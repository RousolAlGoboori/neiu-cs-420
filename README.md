## Chosen Dataset: 

Zomato APIs gives access to the freshest and most exhaustive information for over 1.5 million restaurants across 10,000 cities globally. With the Zomato APIs, we can:
1.	Search for restaurants by name, cuisine, or location.
1.	Display detailed information including ratings, location and cuisine.
1.	Use the Zomato Foodie Index to show great areas to dine in a city

## Application Name:
Restaurant App Using Zomato API


## Project Topic/Objective:

In this project, I'm going to develop a Restaurant App that:

1	Lists the Nearest Restaurants Using Zomato API, it lets us view menus, photos and reviews for restaurants nearby. This is handy if you’re looking for a place to eat in a new city.
1	Get a List of Restaurants in a City by entering the city ID and it will return a list of all available restaurants in the area.

   I would like to answer:

1.	Can I find restaurants nearby based on location?
1.	Can I find restaurants nearby based on name?
1.	Can I find number of registered restaurants with Zomato app in Chicago?

## Motivation:

This is an interesting topic for me because it talks about technology and food, everybody works hard so after long day they need to take a break. they don’t have time to cook so they search for food delivery apps in their play store. 
during the pandemic (COVID19), the food delivery market has grossed a net worth of $30 billion in the U.S. Online food deliveries have become a routine with the increasing usage of mobile phones used for food ordering. food delivery platforms are chasing the whereabouts of their target audience, knowing their demands, knowing what they can do well and where their competitors fail.
